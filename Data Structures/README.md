* [Wikipedia - Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)
* "In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string"
* Useful for searching by prefix among stings with lots of overlap
* Possible dictionary implementation
