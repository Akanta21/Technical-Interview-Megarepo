## System Calls
* Requests to the kernel to perform some privileged operation
* [Wikipedia - System Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call)
* "In computing, a system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system."

## Processes
* [Wikipedia - Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing))
* "In computing, a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It contains the program code and its current activity. Depending on the operating system (OS), a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently"

## Threads
* [Wikipedia - Thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing))
* "In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system."

## Concurrency
* [Wikipedia - Concurrent Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing)
* "Concurrent computing is a form of computing in which several computations are executing during overlapping time periods—concurrently—instead of sequentially (one completing before the next starts)."

## Lock/Mutex
* [University of Wisconson - Locks](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/threads-locks.pdf)
* [Wikiepedia - Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science))
* "In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution. A lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy."

## Semaphores
* [Wikipedia - Semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming))
* "In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access, by multiple processes, to a common resource in a concurrent system such as a multiprogramming operating system."
* [CareerRide - Semaphore](http://www.careerride.com/OS-semaphore.aspx)
* "A semaphore is hardware or a software tag variable whose value indicates the status of a common resource. Its purpose is to lock the resource being used"

## Monitors
* [Wikipedia - Monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization))
* "In concurrent programming, a monitor is a synchronization construct that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to wait (block) for a certain condition to become true. Monitors also have a mechanism for signalling other threads that their condition has been met. "
