## Design Patterns
* [Wikipedia - Software Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
* "In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations."

### Creational Patterns
* [Wikipedia - Creational Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)
* "In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation."
* [Abstract Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern) - "Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes."

### Structural Patterns
* [Wikipedia - Structural Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern)
* "In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities."
* [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) - "In software engineering, the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code."
